# Training & Evaluation Scripts

Entry points that wire Hydra configs, Isaac Sim, and PPO policies.

## Training Execution Flow (`train.py`)

1. **Hydra + W&B setup**
   - Hydra loads `cfg/train.yaml` and constructs the Isaac Sim `AppLauncher`.
   - W&B is initialized from `cfg.wandb` (project, mode, tags).

2. **Create environment and policy**
   - `make_env_policy(cfg)` builds:
     - the vectorized Isaac env (Active Adaptation `_Env` subclass),
     - the PPO policy (`ppo` / `ppo_roa` / `ppo_amp`),
     - optional VecNorm transform.

3. **Rollout and training loop**
   - The env is reset once and a rollout policy is created: `rollout_policy = policy.get_rollout_policy("train")`.
   - A TensorDict buffer `data_buf` of shape `[num_envs, train_every, ...]` is allocated based on a one-step probe.
   - For each iteration:
     - With `ExplorationType.RANDOM`, the rollout policy is applied for `train_every` steps, and `env.step_and_maybe_reset` fills `data_buf` (including `next`-fields and `is_init` masks).
     - The critic is run once on `data_buf` and the bootstrapped `next["state_value"]` is computed.
     - `policy.train_op(data_buf)` is called to perform PPO updates (and any adaptation/estimation steps), returning a metrics dict.
     - Episode stats and env performance metrics are aggregated and logged to W&B; checkpoints are written when `should_save(i)` is true.
   - After training, a final checkpoint is saved and `evaluate(...)` runs an eval rollout with `policy.get_rollout_policy("eval")`, logging results to W&B before clean shutdown.

## Evaluation & visualization
- `play.py` — loads a checkpoint (local path or `run:<wandb-run>`) and runs rollouts; can export ONNX when `export_policy=true`.
- `eval.py` / `eval_multiple.py` / `eval_run.py` — batch evaluation helpers; `eval_run.py` can fetch and visualize remote W&B runs.
- `vis/` — MuJoCo visualization utilities (e.g., `mujoco_mocap_viewer.py`, `motion_data_publisher.py`).

## Typical commands
```bash
# Train (teacher policy)
python scripts/train.py algo=ppo_roa_train task=G1/hdmi/move_suitcase

# Finetune student
python scripts/train.py algo=ppo_roa_finetune task=G1/hdmi/move_suitcase checkpoint_path=run:<teacher-wandb_run_path>

# Evaluate Student
python scripts/play.py algo=ppo_roa_finetune task=G1/hdmi/move_suitcase checkpoint_path=run:<student-wandb_run_path>
```
